## class assigment - 
the ex11 gets two files and checks their equality.

the ex12 gets:

-a folder which contains folders of students with c code of an addition function

-a text file which contains the input for the addition functions

-a text file which contains the output of a correct addition function

it goes through the folders and checks whether there are c codes and then checks if the output of their function is the same as out output using the input we provided. then creates a csv file containing the name of the student, the grade he got and the reason for the grade.
